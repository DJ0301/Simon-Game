# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players need to remember and repeat a pattern of colors and sounds.

## Description

This web-based Simon Game project allows users to play the Simon Game in their browser. The game generates a sequence of colors and sounds that the player must repeat. The player progresses through levels by successfully mimicking the pattern.

## Features

- Generates random sequences of colors and sounds for the player to follow.
- Allows players to start the game with a key press.
- Tracks and displays the player's progress through levels.
- Uses sounds and animations to provide a dynamic gaming experience.
- Displays and updates the player's high score using local storage.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Press any key to start the game.
3. The game will display a sequence of colors and play corresponding sounds.
4. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
5. As you progress, the sequences will become longer and more challenging.

## High Score and Local Storage

The game uses local storage to store and display the player's high score. The high score is the highest level the player has reached. This allows players to compete with themselves and aim for a higher score each time they play.

- When you achieve a new high score, it will be stored in your browser's local storage.
- The high score is displayed at the top of the game interface.
- If you clear your browser's cache or play on a different device, your high score will be reset to the default value.
